## Motivation

I wanted to recreate this project to learn how to do the same things that I had previously done with Vanilla JS with React.JS instead!

## Description

The website is a simple word/character counter that has the added benefit of tracking the character limits of twitter and facebook posts! The site makes use of simple layout/design with smooth animations in the beginning to give it a more professional feel! Additionally, some text validation was implemented for fun!
